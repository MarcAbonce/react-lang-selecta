# React Lang Selecta

> **⚠ Warning! ⚠** This lib is satirical, inspired by my personal experiences dealing with i18n and with front-end code.  

Language selector component with random flag emojies.  

You just give it a list of language codes and it gives you a `select` element with each language as an option along with the flag of the language.  

## How to use

Like this:  

```html
<label>
    Select a language please:
    <LangSelecta langs={['es', 'zh', 'en', 'fr', 'ar']} />
</label>
```

Which should return something like this:  

```html
<label>
    Select a language please:
    <select>
        <option value="fr">🇨🇦 Francese</option>
        <option value="ar">🇱🇧 Arabe</option>
        <option value="es">🇵🇪 Espaniol</option>
        <option value="en">🇨🇦 Anglese</option>
        <option value="zh">🇲🇴 Chinese</option>
    </select>
</label>
```

You could also control the component, style it and use more props. Check out the storybook for more examples.  

## Features included

- Not knowing the difference between a language and a locale.  
- Language names are all written in the international language so you don't get confused with foreign fonts.  
- Random language flags, ensuring that all Nations are treated equally... as long as they're recognized by the ~~USA~~ Unicode Consortium.  
- Leverages the power of popular dependencies such as `left-pad` to avoid reinventing the wheel.  
- Tests mocked component that calls a mocked hook to ensure that empty `div` equals empty `div` snapshot.  
- Every file is called `index` to turn your code editor into a fun maze for the entire family to enjoy.

## Frequently Unasked Questions

1. Where did you get the data about the locales and the regions from?  
    - The data mainly comes from the [Unicode CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org/) v45, specifically through the [Python Babel](https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/) library.  
    - For locales not supported in Python's Babel, the data was obtained from [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com). 🌞📖🙏  

2. The data is wrong and I'm offended!  
    - Fix it upstream in the [Unicode CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org/) so that ~~I don't have to deal with it~~ the entire World can benefit from your contribution.
